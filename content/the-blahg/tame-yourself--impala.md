If you love the show Twin Peaks, Tame Impala, or just can't keep your eyes off of Sherilyn Fenn, this is a video you'll put into rotation. Regardless, the song is a good one.

How cool is this video? It is like the perfect blend of "A Hard Day's Night" and "The Walking Dead".

Another cool video and track by Tame Impala. Love this one.
