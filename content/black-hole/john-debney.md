Academy award nominated John Debney is considered one of the most prolific and successful composers in Hollywood. His unique ability to create memorable work across a variety of genres, as well as his reputation for being remarkably collaborative, have made him the first choice of top level producers and directors. Debney combines his classical training and a strong knowledge of contemporary sounds to easily adapt to any assignment. As a pitch to redo his website, I took the liberty of creating a set of comps to communicate my vision for the site. I created a new logo along with a completely responsive design approach that is highly stylistic. The site would be ajax-loaded to allow for his music to play throughout the user experience. As far as project pages go, custom static and video backgrounds were envisioned to set the mood for the project. If audio from the score was available, it would be associated with the projects as shown. The lower third of the page allows the user to traverse between projects and view related media to the active project they are looking at. An index/list view is also shown, to be usable in either a vertical or horizontal fashion.
