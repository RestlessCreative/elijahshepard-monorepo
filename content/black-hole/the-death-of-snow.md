My wife, J.L. Shepard, is a brilliant author. I worked on cover art for both editions to craft nice typography and a moody feeling for the artwork. There were two versions/editions of the cover. The original photography for the fist edition courtesy of Brooke Shaden and Lilyana Sanches for the second edition. I did additional matte painting and photo manipulation to produce the final result.
