I concepted a game for a company recently acquired by Verizon for 2.4 billion. The game was shelved after the acquisition so it never saw the light of day. But a lot of thought went into it. The idea was a contest-based marketing effort for its customers. In addition to these final screens and earlier iterations, a game document outlining rules and logic was also created. Sketch came in handy on this project!
