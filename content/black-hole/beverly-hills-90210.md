This was a fun one and quite random. I performed as the guitarist for Christina Aguilera when she appeared on 90210. So if you happened to catch the episode or are actually looking at the video above this paragraph, you would have seen me. We did 2 songs at "The Peach Pit", a staple location on the show. The songs we did were "Genie In A Bottle" and "I Turn To You". Fun little one-day shoot. As an anecdote, I'll never forget the awkward moment when I accidentally opened her trailer door, mistaking it for mine. We both kind of paused there for a moment, she on a couch and me in the doorway with one hand on the door and a goofy grin on my face.
