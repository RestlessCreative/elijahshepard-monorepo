I was commissioned to write custom theme music for the 2005 Webby Awards Ceremony. Here is a short reel of the in-show animations for the ceremony. I was able to attend the gala as well. In fact, I sat at the table next to Al Gore. The highlight of the evening for me was watching Rob Corddry, the host of the ceremony, say "well, that was dramatic" after the opening sequence played through. The highlight reel can be viewed here: http://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2005/web/.
