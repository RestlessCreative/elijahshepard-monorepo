Merit/Andrew is a full-service production and motion graphics company specializing in story-driven advertising and entertainment for all media platforms. For this project, I created a custom Wordpress solution to allow them the ability to control the site's content easily. A clean and fun user experience was created to mirror the quirky and jovial personality of the agency. The work section of this site turned out nice; efficient and fun-to-use. As for the design I ended up with, what can I say...like Kim Basinger, I like purple!
