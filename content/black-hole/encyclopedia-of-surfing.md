Encyclopedia of Surfing is the largest online resource of surf history in the world. A massive amount of development went into the architecture and build of EncyclopediaOfSurfing.com. This site is a destination for everything you ever wanted to know about the history, people, companies, and culture surrounding the sport of surfing. Structured as an encyclopedia, all of this info is available to user in an A-Z index. The site also showcases all those who have contributed and supported the gathering of this information. Additionally, functionality was added to allow users to "sponsor" individual pages on the site ("this page is brought to you by ----") based on a tiered fee structure, as a way to cultivate user support and interaction. The site's vision and content is primarily the result of the passion of Matt Warshaw who has spent the majority of his life as a surf historian. Just look him up! He is an authority on the subject.
