This was the first of a set of projects I did with LucasArts while at 2Advanced. Shane Mielke really kicked ass on this one, as usual. Shane and I traveled up to the Presidio a few times during 2007-2008. Always fun to visit the Lucas campus. All of my swag from this time period has all but worn out...sad.
