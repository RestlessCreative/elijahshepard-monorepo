I composed the main theme and additional music for this award winning documentary, **"Flight From Death - Man's Search For Immortality"**. My music was also used in the trailer campaign for the film. Flight from Death (2003) is a documentary film that investigates the relationship of human violence to fear of death, as related to subconscious influences. The film describes death anxiety as a possible root cause of many human behaviors on a psychological, spiritual, and cultural level. It was directed by Patrick Shen, produced by Greg Bennick, and narrated by Gabriel Byrne.
