I composed and produced a massive "backbeat library" which users could blend together to create their own custom ringtones through this "StudioMoto" application. After the user is happy with their timeline, they could send it to their friend's phone number. We used FFMPEG to assemble and encode the videos in the background. This project was one of many I did with Motorola during my time at 2A. Thanks Andy!!
