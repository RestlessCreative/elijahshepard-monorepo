I approached Mathieu Raynault, a successful and respected matte painter, about a redesign of the Raynault VFX website. These are some of the set of comps I came up with to present my approach for the website overhaul. In a nutshell, a user can traverse the site horizontally and vertically. Using page up/down and navigational arrows allows you to progress through vertically. Swipe, Drag, and navigational arrows allow you to progress horizontally. The site would be built in a way where the Browser does not reload the page so content will transition and animate to create a fluid user experience. The main navigation will be globally available and will change to reflect the section you are in. For galleries, related content to the active item you are viewing is represented by nodes along vertical stems which extend below the content. An average of 3 nodes per stem will start inset from the bottom left of the active content and be repeated towards the right respectively based on available content in that category or project. Galleries may be filtered by project or by category. At any time you can switch these filters using the main navigation. When the filters are engaged, an overlay will fade in over content and the filter menu (categories, projects) will be presented. When an active image/video is hovered, the metadata for that item will be presented in the center of the image against an 80% opaque black which will cover the image. For categorical items, a call-to-action to browse/jump to the related project for the active image will be shown in the lower-right below the image.
