I worked with a great agency out of New Jersey, **"1 Trick Pony"**, to deliver a custom experience for **TCM's annual "31 Days of Oscar"** campaign, in 2016. 1 Trick Pony created a great design that made working on the project a fun exercise. Consisting of some 365 movie profiles which I pulled from a JSON file, this site presented films in a on-air schedule format where each film is linked by a common performer.

As part of the project, I also created a game. In the game mode, the user is meant to make as many connections as possible before time runs out. The game was aimed to be a prime viral component, as users shared their scores. Fully responsive and flush with custom animation, the site received rave reviews and significant traffic.
