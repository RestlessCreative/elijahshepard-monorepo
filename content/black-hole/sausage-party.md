I was responsible for the build and development of this site, working from designs supplied by Trigger Global. Being a longtime fan of Seth Rogen and totally amused by the concept of the film, this site was a joy to work on; not to mention the great folks at Trigger Global! Sausage Party, the first R-rated CG animated movie, is about one sausage leading a group of supermarket products on a quest to discover the truth about their existence.
