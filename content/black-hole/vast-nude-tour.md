This one was fun. Jon Crosby, the artist known as VAST, asked me to write a short piece of music that would play at his concerts before and while the band came on stage. I called the piece I wrote "The Vestige". VAST used it for a few years. Was always fun hearing it in person. ...and if you are reading this and don't know VAST, you need to stop what you are doing and go buy some albums.
